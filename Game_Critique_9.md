# Synopsis
Shoot and dodge waves of dragons with your dragons defeat bosses to get further in the run. If you get hit you lose.
# Game Play Summary
Your character and dragons fight other dragons in waves and bosses. The further you go the more it will take to defeat a wave or boss. If your character gets hit then you lose but you keep xp and coins you collected along the way. Use gems to buy other dragons or characters. Leveling up the dragons and characters allow for them to do more damage. The dragons can evolve if you have 2 at their maxed out level. There is a mechanic with evolving which if 2 of the same dragons have the same zodiac symbol they do the maxiumum amount of damage. So to get the best possible dragon you would need 4 of the same dragons with the same symbol, level them up, evolve them so there are 2 mid level dragons, level those up, then finally evolve the 2 maxed out mid stage dragons. There are rarity types to dragons as well they are as follows: common, rare and legendary. The rarer the dragons, the better the ability and or damage. You can get these from dragons eggs although it costs coins or trophies(boss drops) and there is not a garentee that you will get what you want. Althuogh you can sell dragons you do not want.
## Playability
The game get repetitive very quickly since there is not a difference in the runs, unless you do enough damage per second and or dodge to get further in a run. The bosses that you and your friends can defeat changes with different catches to the boss. A boss might be smaller, faster, have more health etc. But even that gets dull. Once you have all the characters a max level and a good dragon set, there is not much to do unless you want to grind to get all of the dragons available.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single player but has functions which keep track of other's scores and show highscore amongst friends. Also keeps track of a boss's health when you or your friends/group members attempt to fight a boss.
### Controls
Slide your finger across the screen left or right. There are not other controls since you automatically shoot when you start a run.
