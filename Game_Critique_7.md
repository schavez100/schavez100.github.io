# Synopsis
Get upgrades, clear rooms, defeat the boss at the end of the level go to the next level and kill your mom (character).
# Game Play Summary
Play as 1 of 11 characters go in rooms kill the enemies. Each character has their own stats and spacebar item that is given at the start. Eventually you will encounter treasure rooms that grant you an upgrade or downgrade. Get to the boss at the end of the level and kill it. Go to the next floor and repeat. On occasion, you will encounter rooms that allow you to use coins to gamble or buy things from a shop. Once you defeat the mom boss, you can choose one of 2 items that will allow you to either fight Isaac or the Devil once you clear the next 2 floors. If you manage to defeat the mom boss within 20 minutes, you can do the boss rush will you select one of the items in the room and fight every almost every boss. If you defeat mom's heart in 30 minutes, you can fight the hush. From there you can either end the run, go to sheol or the cathedral level. During the main run, you encounter deals with the devil (permanently lose hearts for items) or the angel (free item). If you bomb the angel statues, you can fight an angel boss, which will drop a key piece. If you do this, twice you get a key familiar that will open the door in the chest/dark room that allows you to fight mega Satan.
## Playability
Each run is different; you will get different room layouts, bosses, items, secret rooms etc. So not every run is the same unless, you use a seed that will always result in the same outcomes. These "seeded" runs will not allow you to complete achievements.
### Single/Multiplayer
Mostly single player but it does have local multiplayer in which the second player spawns as a "baby" familiar that spawns from one of player one's health and can only shoot normal tear projectiles and cannot be upgraded. The "baby" can be one of many different spawns that are chosen randomly.
### Controls
WASD are movement and the arrow keys are used to shoot the projectiles in that direction. E drops a bomb. Space uses a "spacebar" item. Q uses a pill or card. Tab opens the map is different views: off, in the corner, or full screen transparent. F makes the game full screen. Holding R restarts the run. M mutes and unmutes the game. P pauses the game. Esc also pauses the game.
# Bugs
No bugs occurred during my play through.
# Final Thoughts
The game is fun to play and there is a lot to try to do if you want to 100% (1001% in the expansions) the game. Most of the time I play in hard mode to get more achievements in one run. Using the other characters can make the game easier or very hard. Azazel can fly and shoot a charge beam shot, while the lost can shoot normal tears and fly but has no health or pick up health upgrades. If you are hit as the lost, you lose.
