## Playability

### Single/Multiplayer
Mostly single player but, it does have local multiplayer in which the second player spawns as a "baby" familiar that spawns from one of player one's health and can only shoot normal tear projectiles and can not be upgraded. The "baby" can be one of many different spawns that are chosen randomly.
### Controls
WASD are movement and the arrow keys are use to shoot the projectiles in that direction. E drops a bomb. Space uses a "spacebar" item. Q uses a pill or card. Tab opens the map is different views: off, in the corner, or full screen transparent. F makes the game fullscreen. Holding R restarts the run. M mutes and unmutes the game. P pauses the game. Esc also pauses the game.
