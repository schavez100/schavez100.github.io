# Bugs
No bugs that were found during the duration of the playthrough. However, there is a bug that I know of which causes a feature that grants the user the ability to have fully trained Pokémon and gain an unlimited amount of items in the Poké pelago. This is caused by using the Poké pelago, exiting, then saving the game. Then change the system's time and date to 31/01/2017 23:59 and reope= the game. Wait 1 minute then open the Poké pelago and all the functions will show as completed and give rewards as if the player waiting the full time limit.
