# Game Play Summary
Get your starter then go around catching and leveling up Pokémon that you want on your team. Defeat trial captians and an evil organization. Along the way you will meet several characters who will assist you by giving you a Z crystal which allows your Pokémon to do a strong attack. Eventually you will have fought all and beaten all the trial captains and finished most of the story. Then you go on to fight the elite four and the Pokémon champion. Then do after game quests. 
## Playability
The game has pretty much played like it has for the past 2 decades. Catch/train Pokémon, get gym badges from beating the gym leaders, fight the evil organization/team and your rival. Then beat the elite four and the region's champion.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single-player for most all functions of the game however, there are mutliplayer battles available either through WIFI or near by connections.
### Controls
Third person, the circle pad controls the directional movement. Dpad and circle pad control menus. X opens player menu options. Y opens Rideable Pokémon. A and B are used for speeding up text or moving on to next text box. A is mostly an accept button for options. B is a deny/cancle button for options.
# Bugs
No bugs that were found during the duration of the playthrough. However, there is a bug that I know of which causes a feature that grants the user the ability to have fully trained Pokémon and gain an unlimited amount of items in the Poké pelago. This is caused by using the Poké pelago, exiting, then saving the game. Then change the system's time and date to 31/01/2017 23:59 and reope= the game. Wait 1 minute then open the Poké pelago and all the functions will show as completed and give rewards as if the player waiting the full time limit.
# Final Thoughts
The game is pretty good if you enjoy the past games. Not much to be said about story but, given the newest technologies, it makes it feel more alive. The characters show mood in cutscenes even though it is only text based with no voice overs. I enjoyed the game and I am going to buy the sequel when it comes out. I was really supprised that in one of the "leaked" photos showed that the modeling was done using the 3D modeling software, Maya.
