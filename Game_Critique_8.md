# Bugs
Currently a bug exists were a Pyro using the Dragon's Fury can shoot and damage an enemy through the spawn gates before the round starts. Normally on maps where a team is defending, the attacking team's spawn gates block all damage due to being closed and the round not starting. However, defending players near the gate can be hit with the dragon's fury's projectile.
# Final Thoughts
The game is still good to play. It is not pay to win and it is a free to play game that any one can pick up.
