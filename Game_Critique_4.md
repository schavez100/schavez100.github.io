# Synopsis

# Game Play Summary
Choose from a list of possible "plagues" to be and attempt to infect and kill everyone. You choose where you want to start out on the map. Depending on what geological location you choose, you gain upgrades that make it easier to spread in areas where you started. So if you choose a location that is cold you get updrages that make it eaiser to strive in other cold locations. Each plague has its own attributes that make it better suited for different situations. Once you start, you gain points to upgrade your plague. Each new country you infect, you get upgrade points and get points normally overtime. You can spend the upgrade points abilities: a combination of plague specific abilities and the other catergories of upgrades, symptoms: affects the infected, and transmissions: spread the infection. Once you have spread enough, a cure will slowly begin to be created to cure any living humans. You can also see the track of where the cure is being moved to once it is finished. You can also destroy labs that are made when you see a blue icon apear on the map. The game ends when you have infected and killed everyone on the planet resulting in a win or all infected have been cured resulting in a loss.
