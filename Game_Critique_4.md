# Synopsis
Take control of a plague and use upgrades you acquire to infect and kill everyone. Try your best to prevent a cure from being made to stop your plague.
# Game Play Summary
Choose from a list of possible "plagues" to be and attempt to infect and kill everyone. You choose where you want to start out on the map. Depending on what geological location you choose, you gain upgrades that make it easier to spread in areas where you started. So if you choose a location that is cold you get upgrades that make it easier to strive in other cold locations. Each plague has its own attributes that make it better suited for different situations. Once you start, you gain points to upgrade your plague. Each new country you infect, you get upgrade points and get points normally overtime. You can spend the upgrade points abilities: a combination of plague specific abilities and the other categories of upgrades, symptoms: affects the infected, and transmissions: spread the infection. Once you have spread enough, a cure will slowly begin to be created to cure any living humans. You can also see the track of where the cure is being moved to once it is finished. You can also destroy labs that are made when you see a blue icon appear on the map. The game ends when you have infected and killed everyone on the planet resulting in a win or all infected have been cured resulting in a loss.
## Playability

### Single/Multiplayer
Single-player
### Controls
Point and click depending on that platform you are playing on but it is mostly point and click.
# Bugs
I could not find any bugs unless there were bugs with the graphs that indicate spread and cure progress.
# Final Thoughts
The game is very insightful to how diseases spread and to watch as everyone dies because of the evolving plague. The game plays well however, I do not see it something that I will play for several hours at a time. It would be nice to see the developers add more plagues that are official. The option to play custom plagues made by the community makes it interesting to see what others could do.
