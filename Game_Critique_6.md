Virtual life
# Game Play Summary

## Playability
Could not get imersed in the world given it is like an rpg.
### Single/Multiplayer
Multiplayer
### Controls
WASD for basic movement, Ctrl+R to run or you can enable this in movement menu, Page Up or E to jump, Space to slow ascent when you jump, Page Down or C to crouch, and I think alt walk is an auto walk/run. Left and right click opens option menus depending on what you click on.
# Bugs
When changing your appearance either clothing or character model, if you undid changes, it would show a bugged out model with some of the changes you made. This is only visible from another player's perspective. Something else that I found was that alt walking would cause your character to move in one direction going everything to stop this you have to press a key and it brings you back to the place where it the bug started. I am not sure what key I pressed to stop because I was pressing everything for it to stop. This bug is only visible through the player's perspective.
# Final Thoughts
I can not say that this is a game I would recommend to anyone. It very resource intensive. The only tutorial when you first make your character and start the game is with movement. The game is very confusing to someone who attempts to just play it since there is no set objective. The game appears to be more for social interaction rather than objective based. There is not much that I can say to describe this game when it is only virtual life.
