<h1>Fireball Test Plan</h1>
<p><h2>Introduction:</h2> Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion. On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field â€“ but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field. Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience. This is the final phase of the project, which includes the test plan and the implementation of the game. This test plan contains a comprehensive list of tests that will be performed along with a workflow of how the tests will be executed. </p>
<p><h3>Purpose:</h3> The purpose of the test plan is to gather all of the information needed to plan and control the test effort for this phase.</p>
<p>This Test Plan for the Fireball game supports the following objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Test Strategy: Guidelines that the test will be based on and descriptions of the process to set up a valid test.</li>
        <li>Execution Strategy: How the test will be executed and the process to identify and report bugs, and to fix and implement fixes</li>
        <li>Test Management: Handling the logistics of the test and all the events that come up during execution of a test.</li>
    </ul>
<p><h3>Scope:</h3> This document is intended to provide a test plan to test the Fireball game, which Internation Hobo developed. The test plan will consist of unit, integration, function, performance, and load testing. The testing techniques that will be performed include black box testing. Some test that were omitted in the test plan include: stress, smoke, regression, and complaiance testing. A test plan workflow will be uncluded along with milestones that have been set for the test plan phase.</p>
