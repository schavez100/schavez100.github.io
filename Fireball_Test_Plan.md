<h1>Fireball Test Plan</h1>
<p><h2>Introduction:</h2> Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion. On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field â€“ but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field. Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience. This is the final phase of the project, which includes the test plan and the implementation of the game. This test plan contains a comprehensive list of tests that will be performed along with a workflow of how the tests will be executed. </p>
<p><h2>Purpose:</h2> The purpose of the test plan is to gather all of the information needed to plan and control the test effort for this phase.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify requirements that are to be tested.</li>
        <li>Outline how the tests will be completed.</li>
        <li>Describe the workflow of the testing process that must be executed.</li>
    </ul>
