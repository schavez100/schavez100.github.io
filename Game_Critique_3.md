# Bugs
There was a problem with the ai of some bugs that would cause them to not go to the main crop that would be under attack. Let us say crop 1 is being attacked the player would go there and face the wave of enemies that are targeting crop 1. However, there is a chance that a few enemies will be attacking another crop and the player would not be able to see what crop is being attacked unless they walk around the map to the other crops. There is no indication that other crops are being attacked since the wave has not ended because of the lurking enemies.
# Final Thoughts
The game looked very nice. It played well and there were no noticeable problems with the controls. The map was interesting given the player was moving on a sphere. Although it did make me feel dizzy and after I played, I still felt like everything around me is moving. The mouse sensitivity could have been higher given how quickly one would turn if an enemy were behind them. I liked the life storing system where you lose all your health, then regain it all and use up a life while still being able to play without stopping the gameplay.
