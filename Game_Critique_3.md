# Bugs
There was a problem with the ai of some bugs that would not go to the main crop that would be under attack. Let's say crop 1 is being attacked the player would go there and face the wave of enemies that are targetting crop 1. However, there is a chance that a few enimies will be attacking another crop and the player would not be able to see what crop is being attacked unless they walk around the map to the other crops. There is no indication that other crops are being attacked since the wave has not ended because of the lurking eneimes.
# Final Thoughts
The game looked very nice. It played well and there were no noticable problems with the controls. The map was interesting given the player was moving on a sphere.
